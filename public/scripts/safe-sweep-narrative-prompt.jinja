  Safe Sweep Narrative Prompt

  Expected input: CTX.results_aggregate (output from safe-sweep-aggregate.jinja)
  Contains: org_name, endpoint_count, summary, aggregated_findings

  The aggregation action should publish its result as "results_aggregate".
#}
{%- set data = CTX.results_aggregate -%}
Analyze these aggregated endpoint security validation results for {{ data.org_name }}.

Scan covered {{ data.endpoint_count }} endpoints.

{% if data.summary %}
Overall Summary:
- Average Score: {{ data.summary.average_score }}%
- Grade Distribution: {{ data.summary.endpoints_by_grade }}
{% endif %}

Aggregated Findings (failures grouped by test):
{% for finding in data.aggregated_findings %}
- {{ finding.test_name }} ({{ finding.test_id }}): FAILED on {{ finding.failed_count }}/{{ finding.endpoint_count }} endpoints [{{ finding.severity }}]
  Category: {{ finding.category }}
  MITRE: {{ finding.mitre_id | default('N/A') }}
  Remediation: {{ finding.remediation | tojson }}
{% endfor %}

IMPORTANT: Use the remediation steps provided above. DO NOT invent your own.

Your job:
1. Explain WHY each finding matters (attack scenarios, business risk)
2. Prioritize fixes based on: severity, how many endpoints affected, and attack chain impact
3. Write an executive summary a non-technical person can understand

Respond with JSON containing HTML-formatted text (not markdown):
{
  "executive_summary": "<p>2-3 sentence summary for executives</p>",
  "risk_level": "critical|high|medium|low",
  "endpoint_count": {{ data.endpoint_count }},
  "average_score": <number>,
  "overall_grade": "A|B|C|D|F",
  "critical_findings": [
    {
      "test_id": "ID",
      "name": "Finding name",
      "failed_count": <number>,
      "detail": "Why this matters - attack scenario",
      "severity": "fail|warn"
    }
  ],
  "recommendations": "<h3>Priority 0 - Fix Immediately</h3><p>Brief context</p><ol><li>Action item with affected count</li></ol><h3>Priority 1 - Fix This Week</h3><ol><li>...</li></ol><h3>Priority 2 - Fix This Month</h3><ol><li>...</li></ol>"
}

HTML tags to use:
- <h3> for priority headings
- <ol>/<li> for numbered steps
- <ul>/<li> for bullet lists
- <strong> for emphasis
- <p> for paragraphs

Do NOT use markdown (no ##, **, -, etc.)
