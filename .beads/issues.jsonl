{"id":"rightofboom2026-tkq","title":"Add Endpoint Protection Testing section (Section 6)","description":"## Overview\n\nThe session outline promises \"safely test endpoint detection\" but the current presentation has no dedicated content for this. This is a major gap that needs to be filled before the February 4th session.\n\n## What We're Adding\n\n### New Slides (insert after Break - slide 017)\n\n1. **\"Safe Endpoint Testing\" framing slide**\n   - What \"safe\" means in MSP context\n   - Scoped targets (test ring / lab)\n   - Two-tier approach: production-safe vs lab-fidelity\n   - Expected alerts + rollback/cleanup\n\n2. **\"What Attackers Check First\" slide**\n   - ASR rules disabled/audit mode\n   - AV exclusions on user-writable paths\n   - Local admin sprawl\n   - PowerShell logging gaps\n\n3. **\"Endpoint Validation Sandwich\" slide**\n   - Maps the guardrail pattern to endpoint testing\n   - Deterministic checks → AI explains gaps → Human approves fix\n\n### Live Demo (~12 min)\n\n| Demo | Method | Shows |\n|------|--------|-------|\n| ASR Rules Gap | `Get-MpPreference` | Disabled LSASS protection |\n| AV Exclusion Audit | `Get-MpPreference \\| Select Exclusion*` | Dangerous paths excluded |\n| Atomic Red Team | `Invoke-AtomicTest T1003.001` | Detection fires (or doesn't) |\n| Local Admin Sprawl | `Get-LocalGroupMember` | Shared admin = lateral movement |\n| PowerShell Logging | Registry check | Invisible attacks if disabled |\n\n### Demo Environment\n\n- 2-3 local VMs (one \"good config,\" one \"bad config\")\n- Vendor-neutral (no Intune dependency)\n- Works with any RMM tool\n\n## Key Design Decisions\n\n1. **Vendor-neutral** - PowerShell checks work on any Windows endpoint\n2. **Honest about AI** - \"AI is not the sensor. Your EDR + config baselines are the sensors.\"\n3. **Two-tier testing** - Built-in safe tests for production, Atomic for lab\n4. **MSP framing** - \"Here's what to check, here's how to automate across your fleet\"\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] \"Safe Endpoint Testing\" framing slide created\n- [ ] \"What Attackers Check First\" slide created\n- [ ] \"Endpoint Validation Sandwich\" slide created\n- [ ] Demo scripts tested on local VMs\n- [ ] Pre-recorded backup video of alerts firing\n- [ ] Slide deck renumbered appropriately\n\n## Related Gaps (separate beads)\n\n- MFA exclusions callout in CA slides\n- Network segmentation slide\n- AI risk dynamics explicit framing","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"timfournet@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-22T08:37:04.585721642-06:00","created_by":"Tim Fournet","updated_at":"2026-01-22T08:37:04.585721642-06:00"}
