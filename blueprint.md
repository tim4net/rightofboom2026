1. The "Lafayette Connection" Hook (20 Minutes)

The Shared History: Two Lafayette natives, both former CISOs, who reached the same breaking point with the traditional security labor model.

The Divergent Paths: * Roddy: The CISO who stayed in the trenches of Strategy, Frameworks, and Sherpa-ing MSPs through the Compliance landscape.

Tim: The CISO who moved into Engineering/Product to build the "Agentic" solutions he wished he had when he was in the chair.

The "CISO Confessional": A quick list of things you both used to hate doing manually (Checking MFA logs, verifying backups, chasing "Impossible Travel" alerts).

The 8x Thesis: Defining the "8x Engineer"—an engineer whose leverage is 8x higher because they've successfully automated the CISO's "standard of care" into the stack.

2. Part I: The Compliance Gap (40 Minutes - Roddy Bergeron)

CIS Controls v8 as the North Star: Why these 18 controls are the "Standard of Care," and why we both agreed on this as CISOs.

The "Configuration Drift" Nightmare: Why a "Clean Audit" on Monday is meaningless by Thursday.

The Policy-to-Action Friction: Discussion: Why human review of logs is a mathematical impossibility for an MSP.

3. Part II: The Engineering Shift & Attacker Demo (40 Minutes - Tim Fournet)

Defining Determinism in a Chaos World:

Pure Determinism: Binary code (If/Then).

Environmental Non-Determinism: The API Nuance (429s, 503s).

Probabilistic Reasoning: The LLM "Vibes" layer.

🔴 LIVE DEMO: Attacker-Style Automation

The Phishing Factory: How attackers use LLMs to generate 10,000 unique, context-aware phishing emails per hour.

Automated M365 Infiltration: Showing how a bot can use session-token theft to bypass MFA (Evilginx/AAD-Internals context).

The "Shadow Agent": How attackers move faster than a human tech can log in. Demonstrate the "Mean Time to Pwn" vs "Mean Time to Respond."

4. Part III: The "Guardrail Sandwich" Architecture (45 Minutes - Shared)

Layer 1 (Top Bread): Deterministic Input & Gating (Schema Enforcement, Scope Isolation).

Layer 2 (Meat): Probabilistic Reasoning (Chain of Thought, Contextual Evaluation).

Layer 3 (Bottom Bread): Deterministic Output & Validation (The "Executive Review" Pattern, State Verification).

Visualizing the Sandwich: This needs to be a multi-slide build showing the layers of a sandwich protecting the API call.

5. Part IV: The "Impossible Travel" Lab (30 Minutes)

Evolutionary Walkthrough:

Maturity Level 1: Manual Grind (45 mins human time).

Maturity Level 2: Brute Script (The "Sledgehammer" - high false positives).

Maturity Level 3: The Autonomous Sandwich (The 22-second surgical response that checks the CEO's calendar and verified travel status).

6. Part V: Governance, Liability & Q&A (15 Minutes)

Auditability: Generating "Reasoning Logs" for insurance.

Liability: The "Human-in-the-loop" threshold.

The 2027 Roadmap: Preparing for proactive drift-hunting.

Speaker Preparation Notes:

The "Peer" Vibe: Since you were both CISOs, this isn't a lecture; it's a "fireside chat" between two experts who found two different but complementary solutions to the same problem.

The Attacker Demo: Keep this fast-paced and slightly "scary" to reset the room's energy before the break.
